# MediaLibrarian
An ASP.NET Core Client Server Project. MediaLibrarian lets you browse public media libraries and download shows and movies.

This project aims to be a comfortable solution for downloading public media as private copy. Data sources are MediathekViewWeb, PokemonTV, ServusTV (in progress), TELE5 (in progress) and maybe more. It should integrate into a media server ecosystem (e.g. as Docker container next to a Plex Media Server). Select and download shows or movies via the user interface in browser. Ffmpeg is used to convert videos and streams to mp4.
